        <h1>About the Fender Telecaster</h1><br></br>
        <img src="img1.jpg" id="profilepic"></img><br></br>
        <p>The Fender Telecaster has been around for over 60 years. It was based on the Fender Esquire, and then the Broadcaster. Telecasters (or Teles) come in all sorts of configurations, but the most recognizable form of a tele is the solid body with two single coil pickups form.
            Telecasters have been historically used in many forms of music, from country to rock. The famous guitar solo from the song "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin was recorded on a Telecaster.
